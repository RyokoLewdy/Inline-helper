Basic to do list to remind me what comes next
TO DO
- Layout customization and presets
- ability to move images in boxes without moving boxes
- Zoom options for Images 
- Collapse / Drop down options for the options / settings
- add Markers to designate box numbers that dont show up when images are there.
- add ability to enter number values alongside the sliders
- option to add more boxes / shapes for images

FIX
